# Ultrasound System Testing & Verification Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures to verify the proper functioning of your ultrasound system and optimize its performance, regardless of which build approach you've chosen.

## Prerequisites

- Assembled ultrasound system (either all-in-one or modular approach)
- Basic test equipment:
  - Oscilloscope (at least 50 MHz bandwidth)
  - Multimeter
  - Ultrasound phantom or test target (e.g., wirephantom module)
  - Ultrasound coupling gel
  - Computer with acquisition software installed

## Safety Precautions

- Be aware of high voltages present in the pulse generation circuits
- Always power down the system before connecting/disconnecting components
- Follow proper ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) precautions when handling components
- Use appropriate isolation when connecting test equipment

## Testing Workflow Overview

1. **Power and Connectivity Tests**
2. **Signal Generation Tests**
3. **Signal Reception Tests**
4. **End-to-End Functional Tests**
5. **Performance Optimization**
6. **System Calibration**

## 1. Power and Connectivity Tests

### Power Supply Verification
1. **Voltage measurements**:
   - Measure all supply voltages with a multimeter
   - Verify +5V and ±5V (if applicable) are within ±5% of nominal values
   - Check for voltage stability under load

2. **Current consumption**:
   - Monitor current draw during startup
   - Verify steady-state current is within expected range
   - Check for excessive current draw that might indicate a problem

### Communication Interface Tests
1. **USB/Serial interface** (if applicable):
   - Verify computer recognizes the device
   - Test command communication
   - Check data transfer capability

2. **Inter-module connections** (modular approach):
   - Verify continuity of signal paths between modules
   - Check connector integrity
   - Test for unexpected shorts or opens

## 2. Signal Generation Tests

### Pulse Generator Tests
1. **Trigger signal verification**:
   - Monitor trigger input with oscilloscope
   - Verify correct timing and amplitude
   - Check for clean edges and proper frequency

2. **Output pulse characterization**:
   - Measure output pulse amplitude (use appropriate attenuator for high voltages)
   - Verify pulse width matches expected value
   - Check pulse repetition frequency
   - Look for any ringing or distortion

3. **Performance under load**:
   - Connect to transducer and verify pulse characteristics
   - Check for any degradation under continuous operation

## 3. Signal Reception Tests

### Receiver Chain Verification
1. **Noise floor measurement**:
   - With no signal input, measure noise at various stages
   - Verify noise levels are within acceptable limits

2. **Gain verification**:
   - Apply known test signal (from silent module if available)
   - Verify gain stages are providing expected amplification
   - Check gain control functionality (if applicable)

3. **Time Gain Compensation (TGC) testing**:
   - Verify TGC circuit provides appropriate gain increase over time
   - Test at different depth settings

4. **Filter response**:
   - Verify bandpass characteristics match transducer frequency
   - Check for appropriate signal filtering

## 4. End-to-End Functional Tests

### Basic Echo Detection
1. **Simple target test**:
   - Place a flat, reflective target at a known distance
   - Apply coupling gel
   - Verify echo detection at the correct time/distance
   - Measure signal-to-noise ratio

2. **wirephantom module testing** (if available):
   - Connect to the wirephantom test module
   - Verify detection of known reflectors
   - Measure accuracy of distance determination

### Imaging Performance
1. **B-mode imaging test**:
   - Use a test phantom with known targets
   - Verify detection of all targets
   - Check spatial resolution
   - Assess contrast resolution

2. **Penetration depth test**:
   - Determine maximum depth for acceptable image quality
   - Verify depth calibration accuracy

## 5. Performance Optimization

### Signal Path Optimization
1. **Gain structure adjustment**:
   - Balance gain across all stages for optimal SNR
   - Minimize noise while maximizing useful signal

2. **Filter tuning**:
   - Optimize filter settings for your specific transducer
   - Balance between noise rejection and signal preservation

### Image Quality Improvement
1. **Scan parameter adjustment**:
   - Optimize pulse repetition frequency
   - Adjust scanning speed or frame rate
   - Fine-tune number of scan lines (if applicable)

2. **Processing parameter optimization**:
   - Adjust dynamic range
   - Set appropriate persistence
   - Configure edge enhancement if available

## 6. System Calibration

### Spatial Calibration
1. **Distance calibration**:
   - Use targets at known distances
   - Adjust speed of sound parameter if needed
   - Verify distance measurements across the field of view

2. **Lateral calibration** (if using mechanical scanning):
   - Verify angular position accuracy
   - Calibrate scan conversion parameters

### Amplitude Calibration
1. **Echo intensity calibration**:
   - Use standardized reflectors if available
   - Create reference table for echo intensities
   - Verify consistency across the field of view

## Performance Benchmarking

After completing all tests, record these key performance metrics:

1. **Axial resolution** (ability to distinguish targets along beam axis)
2. **Lateral resolution** (ability to distinguish adjacent targets)
3. **Penetration depth** (maximum useful imaging depth)
4. **Signal-to-noise ratio** at various depths
5. **Dynamic range** (range from minimum detectable signal to saturation)
6. **Frame rate** (for real-time imaging systems)

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Low echo amplitude | Insufficient gain, poor coupling, transducer issue | Increase gain, improve coupling, check transducer |
| Multiple reflections | High gain, strong reflectors | Reduce gain, adjust TGC curve |
| Lateral blurring | Poor focusing, excessive scan line density | Adjust focusing, optimize scan parameters |
| Axial blurring | Bandwidth issues, filter problems | Adjust filters, check pulse width |
| Noise artifacts | EMI issues, ground problems | Improve shielding, check ground connections |
| Missed targets | Gain too low, beam alignment issue | Increase gain, verify alignment |
